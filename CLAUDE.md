# autopunk-media-skills
**The most comprehensive Claude skill library for media professionals.**  
GitHub: https://github.com/ur-grue/autopunk-media-skills · License: MIT

## What This Project Is

A curated, quality-tested library of Claude skills for journalists, documentary filmmakers, YouTube creators, podcast producers, and visual content creators.

**Not a coding library.** Every skill helps media professionals produce better content faster — treatments, scripts, headlines, image prompts, show notes, and more.

**Target users:** Media professionals who may have no technical background. Everything they see must be immediately understandable without reading documentation.

For full vision and roadmap → see `ROADMAP.md`  
For contribution rules → see `CONTRIBUTING.md`  
For skill format → see `SKILL_TEMPLATE.md`  
For testing protocol → see `tests/EVAL_FRAMEWORK.md`

---

## Language Rule

**All repository content is in English.** Skills, README, docs, commit messages, issue templates — everything. Target audience is the international media community.

---

## Anonymity Rule

**Never reference the maintainer's employer, specific productions, or identifiable real-world projects in any file.** All examples must be generic, professional, and untraceable. The maintainer identity is Ur-grue only.

## Skill Status System

| Badge | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 🔲 `planned` | Placeholder only | File exists, skill not yet written |
| 🟡 `draft` | Written, untested | Do not use in production |
| 🔵 `beta` | Tested once | Usable, may have edge cases |
| ✅ `stable` | G-Eval ≥ 4.0/5 | Production-ready |

**A skill is only `stable` after passing the G-Eval protocol in `tests/EVAL_FRAMEWORK.md`.**

---

## Skill Format

Every skill follows this exact template. Standalone version is in `SKILL_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Testing Protocol (Summary)

Full protocol in `tests/EVAL_FRAMEWORK.md`.

**Standard:** G-Eval (NLG Evaluation using GPT-4 with Better Human Alignment)  
**Threshold for `stable`:** (Overall mean ≥ 4.0/5 across all seven dimensions) AND (Editorial Naturalness ≥ 4.0/5 individually as a hard floor)

| Dimension | What It Measures |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Coherence | Well-structured and logically organized? |
| Consistency | Free of contradictions and invented facts? |
| Fluency | Natural, readable, professional language? |
| Relevance | Addresses exactly what was asked — no more, no less? |
| Professionalism | Acceptable to an experienced media professional as-is? |
| Actionability | Usable directly in production without major revision? |
| Editorial Naturalness | Reads like a human professional in the medium, not generic AI output? *(hard floor — see EVAL_FRAMEWORK.md for the rubric anchored on observable lexical, structural, tonal, and genre tells)* |

**To run an eval in Claude Code:**
```
Run G-Eval for [skill-name].
Read the skill file. Generate 3 test outputs using varied inputs.
Score each output on all 7 dimensions (1-5 scale), including Editorial Naturalness.
For Editorial Naturalness, count tells against the four lists (lexical, structural, tonal, genre)
and add a one-line note naming the strongest tell or the strongest piece of genre craft.
Report mean per dimension and overall average.
If overall mean ≥ 4.0 AND editorial_naturalness mean ≥ 4.0, set status to stable
and update eval_score in frontmatter. Otherwise keep status as beta.
```

**Important:** Raw eval data stays internal. The public sees only the badge and score in the skill frontmatter. Detailed quality evidence is published as readable PDF reports — not code or JSON — so any media professional can understand the quality standard without technical knowledge.

---

## Git Workflow

End every session:
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "type: description (category/subcategory)"
git push origin main
```

Types: `feat` · `fix` · `test` · `docs` · `chore`

```
feat: add hook-generator skill (youtube/pre-production)
test: G-Eval hook-generator — score 4.4/5, marked stable
fix: improve example in pitch-treatment-writer
chore: update ROADMAP.md statuses
```

---

## Non-Negotiable Quality Rules

1. Real examples only — no placeholders anywhere.
2. Generic examples only — nothing traceable to a real production or organization.
3. Every skill documents at least one honest limitation.
4. No skill reaches `stable` without a passing G-Eval.
5. All public-facing language is non-technical — written for journalists and producers, not developers.

---

## First Run Instructions

**If this is the first session and the repository is empty, execute all five phases in order. Do not stop between phases.**

### Phase 1 — Foundation files (6 files)

**README.md**  
Public landing page. Audience: a journalist or TV producer who has never heard of "Claude skills." Must answer in plain language: What is this? Who is it for? How do I use a skill (3 steps, no jargon)? What categories exist and how many skills are in each? What do the quality badges mean? How can I contribute? No technical language in the first two sections.

**LICENSE**  
MIT license. Copyright holder: Ur-grue.

**CHANGELOG.md**  
One entry: `## v0.1.0 — Repository initialized. Full structure and skill placeholders created.`

**CONTRIBUTING.md**  
How to propose and submit a skill. First section: zero git jargon, written for a non-developer. Explain: why contribute, what makes a good skill, how to submit (open a GitHub Issue first, then a Pull Request). Second section: technical PR instructions for contributors who know git.

**SKILL_TEMPLATE.md**  
The skill template from this file as a clean standalone document. Add a short usage guide above the template: when to use it, how to fill each field, what counts as a good example.

**ROADMAP.md**
All ~229 skills listed by category. For each: name, one-line description, status badge. Summary at top: X stable · X beta · X draft · X planned. This file is the living task list — update it every session.

---

### Phase 2 — GitHub community files (4 files)

**.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/skill-request.md**  
Fields: Skill name · Media format · What problem it solves · Example input · What the output should look like.

**.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/quality-report.md**  
Fields: Skill name · Input used · Output received · What was wrong · What a good output would look like.

**.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.md**  
Fields: Skill name · Steps to reproduce · What happened · What should have happened.

**.github/pull_request_template.md**  
Checklist: skill follows template · example is real not placeholder · limitations documented · self-tested at least once · no identifiable real-world references.

---

### Phase 3 — Test infrastructure (2 files)

**tests/EVAL_FRAMEWORK.md**  
Two sections:  
(A) Technical protocol for Claude Code: how to generate test outputs, how to run G-Eval scoring, how to record results, when to mark stable.  
(B) Plain-language explanation for any human reviewer: what the six dimensions mean in practical terms, what a score of 4.0 vs 5.0 looks like in a real media context, why this matters. Written so a journalist can read section B and immediately understand the quality system.

**tests/COMMUNITY_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md**  
Five yes/no questions any user can answer after trying a skill, with no technical knowledge required. Example questions: "Could you use this output in your work without major editing?" · "Did the output stay on topic?" Plain English throughout.

### Phase 4 — Skill placeholders (~229 files + matching .evals.json files)

Create every skill file listed in the Repository Structure. Each file:
- `status: planned`
- "What This Skill Does": one-line description of what the skill will do
- All other fields: `TBD`

Create a matching `.evals.json` for each skill:
```json
{
  "skill_name": "skill-name",
  "status": "pending",
  "test_cases": []
}
```

### Phase 5 — Session summary report

After completing all phases, output:
- Total files created (foundation + GitHub + tests + skill placeholders)
- Any structural decisions made and why
- One recommended first skill to develop to `stable` (pick based on: broadest appeal across all media formats, clearest possible eval criteria, demonstrable in under 60 seconds)
- Exact command to paste at the start of the next session to continue development
