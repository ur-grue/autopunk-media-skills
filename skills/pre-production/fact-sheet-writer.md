# Fact Sheet Writer

## What This Skill Does
Produces a concise, structured fact sheet on any topic for production teams — covering key facts, essential terminology, background context, and common misconceptions — so crew and contributors arrive on set informed.

## When To Use This Skill
- Your crew is filming on an unfamiliar topic and needs a shared knowledge baseline before the shoot
- You are preparing an interviewer or presenter who has limited time to research the subject
- A contributor or consultant is joining the production and you want the team to understand their area of expertise
- You need a one-page briefing document to share with funders, commissioners, or co-producers who are new to the subject

## What You Need To Provide
**Required:**
- The topic or subject area the fact sheet should cover
- The intended audience for the fact sheet (e.g., non-specialist TV crew, broadcast journalist, documentary director)

**Optional:**
- The specific angle or focus of the production (e.g., "we are covering the economic impact, not the scientific debate")
- Any terminology the team is already familiar with that can be skipped
- Key questions the production is trying to answer — helps Claude prioritise what to include
- Geographic or temporal scope (e.g., "focus on the situation in West Africa since 2015")
- Contributor names or expert roles whose work should be referenced if relevant
- Maximum length or number of sections

## How Claude Approaches This
1. Identifies the core concepts a non-specialist would need to understand the topic at a production-ready level — not academic depth, but enough to ask good questions and follow expert answers
2. Organises the material into a logical sequence: overview first, then key facts and figures, then terminology, then context and history, then common misconceptions or areas of public confusion
3. Writes every section in plain, confident language — no jargon without explanation, no hedging, no filler — so the document can be read in ten minutes and retained

## Output Format
A single document of 400–700 words, divided into clearly labelled sections with bold headers. Each section uses short paragraphs or bullet points, not dense prose. Tone is informative and neutral — this is a briefing, not an editorial. All facts and figures are presented with enough context to be meaningful to a non-specialist reader.

## Quality Criteria
- [ ] A crew member with no prior knowledge of the topic could read this and hold an informed conversation about it
- [ ] All key terms are defined in plain language the first time they appear
- [ ] The fact sheet is scoped to the production's angle — it does not try to cover everything
- [ ] No section is padded; every sentence adds information the reader needs
- [ ] Common misconceptions are flagged clearly so the team does not repeat them on camera

## Example

### Input
Topic: Deep-sea mining
Production angle: A documentary exploring whether deep-sea mining should be permitted in international waters, focusing on the environmental and regulatory debate.
Audience: TV documentary crew — director, DOP, production manager. None are scientists. The director has read one newspaper article about it.
Key questions the production is trying to answer: What is actually being mined? Who controls international waters? What are the main environmental concerns? Who are the main players for and against?

# FACT SHEET: Deep-Sea Mining
*Prepared for production team — The [Working Title] Documentary*

## What It Is

Deep-sea mining refers to the extraction of mineral deposits from the ocean floor, typically at depths of 1,400 to 6,000 metres. Three types of deposits are commercially targeted: **polymetallic nodules** (potato-sized lumps containing nickel, cobalt, copper, and manganese that lie on the seabed), **seafloor massive sulphides** (mineral-rich crusts formed around hydrothermal vents), and **cobalt-rich crusts** (thin layers on the slopes of underwater mountains). The minerals extracted are in high demand for batteries, electric vehicles, and electronics.

---

## Key Facts and Figures

- The richest deposits are concentrated in three Pacific Ocean zones: the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (between Hawaii and Mexico), the Central Indian Ocean Basin, and the area around the mid-Atlantic ridge.
- The Clarion-Clipperton Zone alone is estimated to contain more nickel, cobalt, and manganese than all known land-based reserves combined.
- No commercial deep-sea mining operation has yet been approved or conducted in international waters, as of early 2026.
- Over 30 exploration licences have been issued, held by companies from 19 countries.

## Who Is In Charge of International Waters

The **International Seabed Authority (ISA)** is the UN body that regulates all mining-related activity in international waters (the area beyond any nation's 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone). The ISA issues exploration licences and is currently finalising a Mining Code — the set of rules that would govern commercial extraction. As of 2026, that code has not been adopted, meaning no commercial mining can legally proceed. Member states are divided: some (notably small Pacific island nations and several European countries) want a moratorium until the environmental impact is better understood; others (including some sponsoring nations for mining companies) want the code finalised so extraction can begin.

## The Environmental Concerns

- Mining machines the size of a car would crawl across the seabed, vacuuming up nodules and releasing sediment plumes that can drift for hundreds of kilometres, smothering filter-feeding organisms.
- Deep-sea ecosystems are extraordinarily slow to recover — some nodule fields are estimated to have formed over millions of years; a disturbed habitat may take centuries to recover even partially.
- Hydrothermal vent communities host unique species found nowhere else on Earth; vents targeted for sulphide mining could be permanently destroyed.
- Scientists argue that less than 0.001% of the deep ocean has been studied — we do not yet know what we would be destroying.

---

## The Industry Argument

Proponents argue that deep-sea mining could supply the metals needed for the global transition away from fossil fuels, with less environmental disruption than land-based mining (which often involves deforestation, toxic tailings, and community displacement). The company most advanced in the field, The Metals Company (Canada/Nauru), argues that the nodule fields it targets have lower biodiversity than tropical rainforests cleared for land mining.

## Essential Terminology

| Term | What It Means |
|------|--------------|
| Polymetallic nodules | Mineral-rich lumps on the seabed; the main mining target |
| ISA | International Seabed Authority — the UN regulator |
| The Area | UN term for the seabed beyond national jurisdiction |
| Mining Code | The ISA's pending rulebook for commercial extraction |
| Sediment plume | Cloud of disturbed seafloor material released by mining equipment |
| Hydrothermal vent | Crack in the ocean floor releasing superheated water; host to unique ecosystems |
| Sponsoring state | Country that backs a mining company's ISA licence application |

## Common Misconceptions to Avoid on Camera

- **"It's just like fishing, but on the seabed."** It is not. The machinery is industrial-scale and the ecosystems are irreplaceable on any human timescale.
- **"It's already happening."** No commercial mining has been approved. What exists are exploration licences and test operations.
- **"It's an either/or with land mining."** Most environmental groups argue both are harmful and that demand reduction and recycling are the real alternatives.

## Known Limitations
- Claude generates fact sheets from its training data, which has a knowledge cutoff. For a fast-moving regulatory or scientific topic, have a specialist check figures and update any recent developments before the shoot
- The fact sheet covers the scope you define — if the production angle shifts, request a revised version rather than patching the existing one
- For topics involving contested science (climate projections, medical research, economic modelling), Claude will present the mainstream consensus; if your production requires a specific dissenting position to be represented fairly, specify this in your input
- Contributor-specific facts (quotes, publication titles, institutional affiliations) should always be verified directly with the contributor before use on camera
