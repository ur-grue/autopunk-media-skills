# Budget estimator

## What this skill does
Generates a structured production budget estimate for a specific project element or an entire short-form production, broken down by standard industry cost categories.

## When to use this skill
- You are preparing a budget for a pitch deck or funding application and need realistic line items
- A commissioner or funder has asked for a cost breakdown and you need a starting framework
- You want to sanity-check your own budget against industry norms before submitting
- You are comparing production approaches (studio vs. location, in-house vs. freelance) and need cost estimates for each

## What you need to provide
**Required:**
- Project type (documentary, short film, podcast series, corporate video, etc.)
- Duration or scope (e.g., "6 × 30-minute episodes" or "one 90-second brand video")
- Key production elements (number of shoot days, locations, crew size, talent, post-production needs)
- Territory or market (costs vary dramatically between countries and cities)

**Optional:**
- Known fixed costs (e.g., "archive licensing budget is capped at €5,000")
- Format constraints (e.g., "4K delivery required" or "must include subtitles in three languages")
- Whether this is for internal planning or external submission (affects level of detail)

## How Claude approaches this
1. Identifies the production type and maps it to standard budget categories (development, pre-production, production, post-production, delivery, overheads, contingency)
2. Estimates realistic cost ranges for each line item based on the territory, scale, and format specified
3. Flags assumptions made (day rates, equipment costs, post-production timelines) so you can adjust with real quotes
4. Adds a contingency line (typically 10% for controlled productions, 15–20% for location-heavy or international work)
5. Notes which line items are most likely to be challenged by funders or commissioners

## Output format
A structured budget table with:
- Category headings (development, pre-production, production, post-production, delivery, overheads, contingency)
- Line items with unit cost, quantity, and subtotal
- Notes column explaining assumptions
- Summary totals per category and grand total
- A short "budget notes" section flagging the three biggest cost risks

Currency matches the territory specified. Estimates given as ranges where exact costs depend on quotes.

## Quality criteria
- [ ] Every line item has a unit cost, quantity, and subtotal — no lump sums without explanation
- [ ] Assumptions are stated explicitly (e.g., "camera operator day rate estimated at €450/day based on Western European freelance market")
- [ ] Contingency is included and justified
- [ ] The budget is structured so a funder or commissioner can read it without explanation
- [ ] Cost ranges are realistic for the specified territory and market

## Example

### Input
Project: 3-part documentary series (3 × 45 minutes) about urban farming initiatives across three European cities. Production includes interviews, observational shooting, some aerial drone footage, and archival material. Budget territory: Germany/Western Europe. This is for a public broadcaster funding application.

**Budget notes:**
1. **Archive licensing is the wildcard.** €5,000 is a placeholder. If the series uses significant broadcast archive, this could triple. Get clearance quotes early.
2. **Drone costs assume local operators in each city.** Flying your own drone internationally adds permit complexity and may require local co-pilots. Budget could rise by €2,000–4,000 if permits are difficult.
3. **Music licensing vs. original score.** The €9,000/episode estimate covers a modest original score. Library music would reduce this to €1,500–2,500/episode but limits exclusivity.

## Known limitations
- All costs are estimates based on typical Western European rates. Actual costs depend on specific quotes, crew availability, and market conditions at time of production.
- Does not account for co-production financing structures, tax incentives, or regional fund requirements that may affect budget presentation.
- Cannot predict archive licensing costs without knowing specific sources. Always get quotes before committing a figure to a funder.
- Day rates vary significantly even within the same market. These estimates assume mid-range freelancers, not top-tier specialists.
