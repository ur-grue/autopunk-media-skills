# Presenter Briefing Writer

## What This Skill Does
Drafts a concise, production-ready briefing document that gives a presenter or on-screen moderator everything they need to walk into a shoot or live recording fully prepared.

## When To Use This Skill
- A presenter, host, or moderator is joining your production and needs a single document they can read in under 20 minutes
- You are briefing a guest expert who will appear on camera in a presenting or moderating role
- Your regular presenter is covering an unfamiliar topic and needs background brought up to speed quickly
- You are handing off to a freelance presenter and need to transfer all essential context cleanly

## What You Need To Provide
**Required:**
- Name and role of the presenter being briefed
- Programme or segment title and format (documentary, news package, panel discussion, YouTube series, etc.)
- Topic or story the presenter is covering
- Key facts, background context, or story beats you want them to know
- Names and roles of any contributors, interviewees, or panellists they will meet

**Optional:**
- Tone and register of the programme (serious investigative, warm and conversational, fast-paced, etc.)
- Questions or discussion threads the presenter should drive
- Topics or areas to avoid (legal sensitivities, off-limits subjects agreed with contributors)
- Logistical details (shoot location, schedule, crew contacts)
- Links or source documents to read further

## How Claude Approaches This
1. Opens with a one-paragraph "big picture" summary — the story, why it matters, and the presenter's role in it — so they have an immediate frame before reading the detail.
2. Organises background information by topic in short, scannable sections with clear headers. Prioritises what the presenter needs to know to sound authoritative, not everything that exists on the subject.
3. Profiles each contributor or interviewee in 3–5 lines: who they are, why they are in the programme, what they are likely to say, and any sensitivities to bear in mind.
4. Lists suggested questions or discussion angles (if requested), framed the way a presenter would actually say them on camera rather than as a researcher's note-to-self.
5. Closes with a short logistics section and a named production contact for day-of queries.

## Output Format
Structured document, 600–900 words for a standard briefing. Uses clear headers (bold or H3), short paragraphs, and bullet points within sections. Written in plain, direct English — no jargon, no academic register. The presenter should be able to absorb it during a car journey to the shoot. Tone is professional and collegial: informing a capable person, not lecturing them.

## Quality Criteria
- [ ] The opening paragraph gives the full story context in plain language without requiring any prior knowledge
- [ ] Every contributor is profiled with enough detail that the presenter would recognise them and understand their significance before meeting them
- [ ] Sensitive areas or off-limits topics are clearly flagged, not buried
- [ ] Suggested questions (if included) are phrased naturally, not as interview-prep bullet lists
- [ ] The document can be read end-to-end in under 20 minutes
- [ ] No placeholder text or TBD sections remain anywhere

## Example

### Input
Presenter: Mariana Osei, freelance journalist, joining for one shoot day
Programme: A documentary episode for a streaming platform about urban food deserts — areas where affordable fresh food is inaccessible
Topic: A housing estate in a mid-size city where the last supermarket closed two years ago, and residents have organised a community food hub in response
Contributors: (1) Sandra Kowalski, 58, retired, chair of the estate's residents' association and driving force behind the food hub. (2) Dr. Priya Nair, academic researcher in food poverty at a university — appearing via interview at her office. (3) Owen Fletcher, 34, local councillor whose planning decisions are linked to the supermarket closure — he has agreed to an interview but may be defensive.
Tone: Warm, human-centred, not polemical. We want to tell the residents' story, not make a political attack piece.
Avoid: Do not ask Owen Fletcher directly about a planning conflict-of-interest allegation — this is under legal review and off the record.
Shoot day schedule: 09:00 arrive estate → 10:00 Sandra interview → 13:00 food hub observational filming → 15:30 Owen Fletcher interview

**The Story in Brief**

Two years ago, the only full-size supermarket serving the Fernwood Estate closed. Around 4,000 residents — many elderly, many without cars — were left without affordable fresh food within reasonable reach. Rather than wait for a solution, a group of residents built one: a volunteer-run community food hub operating out of a converted ground-floor flat. This episode follows that community response, asks why the situation was allowed to develop, and looks at what it reveals about food access in post-austerity Britain. Your role is to guide the audience through their story with warmth and curiosity — this is not a confrontational investigation.

---

**Background: Food Deserts**

A "food desert" is an area where residents cannot easily access affordable, nutritious food — typically because large supermarkets have withdrawn and only convenience stores or fast-food outlets remain. The UK has seen a significant increase in these areas since 2010, concentrated in lower-income urban estates. Research links food deserts to higher rates of diet-related illness and increased household food costs despite lower incomes.

**Contributors**

**Sandra Kowalski — Residents' Association Chair**
Sandra, 58, has lived on the Fernwood Estate for 26 years. When the supermarket closed, she co-founded the community food hub and now runs it with a team of 12 volunteers. She is the heart of this episode — articulate, proud, occasionally emotional on the subject. She has been filmed before and is comfortable on camera. She will want to focus on what the community built, not on grievance. Follow her lead: ask her to show you the hub rather than just describe it.

**Dr. Priya Nair — Food Poverty Researcher**
Priya studies supermarket withdrawal from low-income areas. She will provide the structural context: why supermarkets leave, who bears the cost, what policy could prevent it. She interviews at her university office later in the schedule (not today). Her research directly references estates like Fernwood. She is precise and quotable — let her finish her sentences.

**Owen Fletcher — Local Councillor**
Owen, 34, sat on the planning committee that approved the development scheme that preceded the supermarket's closure. He has agreed to speak but will likely be cautious and may use political language to deflect. He is not hostile — approach him as someone who wants to explain his position. Keep questions factual and specific to the planning timeline. **Important: do not raise or allude to any conflict-of-interest allegation — this is subject to ongoing legal review. If he raises it himself, do not follow up. Flag to the director immediately.**

---

**Suggested Questions**

For Sandra:
- "When did you realise the supermarket wasn't coming back — and what made you think 'we can do something about this ourselves'?"
- "What do you say to people who tell you this isn't a charity's job to fix?"

For Owen Fletcher:
- "Walk me through the planning committee's thinking at the time of the development approval."
- "Looking at where the estate is now — what should have happened differently?"

## Known Limitations
- Claude cannot verify factual claims about contributors — all background details supplied must be checked by the production team before the document is handed to the presenter.
- The skill does not generate programme-specific question lists without input; you must supply the interview direction you want the presenter to take.
- For complex legal or editorial sensitivities (e.g., ongoing litigation, anonymised sources), always have the briefing reviewed by your editorial or legal team before distribution.
- Briefings for live programmes (news panels, awards hosting) may need a different format — this skill is optimised for pre-recorded documentary and factual television.
