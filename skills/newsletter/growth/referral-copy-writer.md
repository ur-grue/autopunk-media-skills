# Referral Copy Writer

## What This Skill Does
Writes the in-email referral section that asks existing subscribers to share the newsletter with colleagues or friends — including the ask, the framing of the reward or reciprocity, and the specific share copy subscribers can use verbatim.

## When To Use This Skill
- You are integrating a referral programme (such as SparkLoop, Beehiiv referrals, or a manual tracking system) and need copy for the in-newsletter ask
- You want to add an occasional organic sharing prompt to your newsletter without a formal referral programme
- Your subscriber growth has plateaued from your own channels and you want to activate word-of-mouth from your existing list
- You are launching a new referral tier or changing reward levels and need fresh copy to announce it

## What You Need To Provide
**Required:** Newsletter name, voice, and audience; whether you are running a formal referral programme with rewards or just asking for organic sharing
**Optional:** The specific rewards you offer at each referral tier (e.g. "3 referrals = exclusive monthly Q&A access; 10 referrals = one year paid subscription free"); your unique referral link format; any data on your subscriber base that makes the sharing ask feel meaningful (e.g. "our readers are mostly professionals who know other professionals in the same field"); a short description of the type of reader most likely to appreciate the newsletter

## How Claude Approaches This
1. Opens with the value-first framing: before the ask, gives the reader a brief reminder of why they find the newsletter worthwhile — this activates the psychological state most likely to lead to sharing
2. Makes the ask specific and personal: "forward this to one colleague who..." is consistently more effective than "share with your network"; the copy names the ideal recipient to help the reader picture a real person
3. If there are referral rewards, presents them simply and concretely — a table or a brief tier list, not a paragraph of programme mechanics. Avoids making the rewards sound like the primary reason to share (this backfires by making sharing feel transactional)
4. Provides 2–3 lines of ready-to-copy share text that subscribers can paste into a message, email, or social post — removing the effort of composing their own recommendation is the single highest-leverage referral conversion technique
5. Closes with the referral link placeholder and a low-pressure sign-off

## Output Format
A single inline section designed to sit within or at the end of a newsletter edition — not a standalone email. Length: 100–200 words for organic sharing ask; 150–250 words if referral rewards are involved. Includes a labelled placeholder for the personalised referral link. Pre-written share copy provided as a clearly labelled block. Tone matches the newsletter's stated voice throughout.

## Quality Criteria
- [ ] The ask names the specific type of person the subscriber should think of — not "someone who might enjoy this" but "a colleague who spends too much time trying to make sense of regulatory announcements"
- [ ] Pre-written share copy sounds like something a human would actually send — not a marketing message in the subscriber's voice
- [ ] Referral reward tiers (if applicable) are presented simply enough to understand in 10 seconds
- [ ] The tone of the referral section matches the rest of the newsletter — a sharp analytical newsletter does not get a warm effusive sharing ask
- [ ] The section ends with a clear mechanism: a link placeholder, a forward instruction, or both

## Example

### Input
Newsletter: *The Friction Report*
Voice: Sharp, data-driven, slightly sardonic. Product managers and UX professionals.
Referral programme: Yes — using a formal programme. Rewards: 3 referrals = access to a monthly live data-teardown session (normally $40); 10 referrals = one-year free paid subscription. Personalised referral link format: [YOUR REFERRAL LINK]
Subscriber profile: Mid-to-senior product managers and UX leads, mostly at tech companies and agencies

### Output

---

**If you know someone who'd read this**

If you have a colleague who still cites the Nielsen Norman Group the way people cite scripture — well-intentioned, but possibly due an update — they'd probably get something out of *The Friction Report*.

Here's a link you can send them directly: **[YOUR REFERRAL LINK]**

Refer 3 people and you'll get into the monthly live data teardown (the kind of session where someone shares a product decision, we look at what the research actually says, and it usually goes poorly for the product). Refer 10 and the paid subscription is on me for a year.

If you'd rather just forward this:

> *"I read The Friction Report for UX research that actually challenges received wisdom rather than confirming it. Worth a look if you're tired of advice that's just vibes with a citation attached."*

No pressure either way — if you find it useful, someone else probably will too.

## Known Limitations
- Referral copy works best when it appears in editions with high engagement — a re-engagement or routine low-open edition is not the right context for a sharing ask
- Reward-based referral programmes require infrastructure (a referral platform, tracking, fulfilment) that this skill does not provide; the copy assumes that infrastructure is in place
- Organic sharing asks without any reward have a low absolute conversion rate — this skill will write them effectively, but expects the newsletter to have strong enough content that sharing feels like a genuine act of recommendation rather than a favour to the publisher
- The pre-written share copy provided by this skill should be tested for voice fit by the editor — what sounds natural in the newsletter's register may not sound natural coming from an individual subscriber
