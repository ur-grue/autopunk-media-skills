# Edition Writer

## What This Skill Does
Writes a complete, publication-ready newsletter edition — opening hook, main feature, curated links section, and signed-off closing — from a brief and source material provided by the editor.

## When To Use This Skill
- You have the raw material for an edition (notes, article links, a rough angle) and need to turn it into polished prose
- You are behind schedule and need to draft a full edition quickly without losing voice consistency
- You want a structural first draft you can edit rather than write from scratch
- You are testing a new recurring format or section and want a full example to evaluate before committing

## What You Need To Provide
**Required:** The newsletter's name and voice description (tone, register, personality); the main story or topic for the edition with key facts, data, or quotes you want included; any links or brief summaries for a curated section (if applicable)
**Optional:** Ideal word count range; the newsletter's typical structure (e.g. "we always open with a one-paragraph hook, then the main essay, then 4–5 links with commentary"); any recurring elements like a sign-off catchphrase or named section titles; examples of past editions you liked

## How Claude Approaches This
1. Reads the brief and identifies the edition's central argument or hook — the single insight or revelation that makes this edition worth opening
2. Drafts the opening paragraph as a standalone hook: specific enough to be credible, surprising or arresting enough to hold attention, and clearly connected to the main piece
3. Writes the main feature: structured as a cohesive essay or reported piece, not a list of facts. Integrates provided data, quotes, and angles without padding. Maintains the newsletter's stated voice throughout
4. Composes the curated links section with original commentary for each link — not just descriptions, but the editor's actual opinion or framing, matching the newsletter's perspective
5. Writes a closing that feels personal and earned, not formulaic — a brief reflection, a look ahead, or a direct address to the reader that matches the edition's emotional register

## Output Format
A complete edition structured in clearly labelled sections: **Opening**, **Main Feature**, **Links & Reading**, **Sign-off**. Length calibrated to the brief — default is 600–900 words for the main feature, 50–80 words per curated link, and a 60–100 word closing. Prose style matches the stated newsletter voice. No section headers in the final output unless the newsletter uses them; if in doubt, headers are omitted to preserve a natural reading flow.

## Quality Criteria
- [ ] The opening paragraph works as a standalone hook — it creates a reason to read without requiring any prior context
- [ ] The main feature has a clear through-line: it builds toward something rather than presenting information as a flat list
- [ ] Every curated link has original commentary, not a summary — it should reflect the editor's perspective
- [ ] The closing is specific to this edition, not a generic sign-off that could appear in any issue
- [ ] The entire edition reads as one consistent voice — no section should feel like it was written by a different writer

## Example

### Input
Newsletter: *Shelf Life*
Voice: Thoughtful, a little melancholy, literary. Like a letter from a well-read friend who happens to work in publishing. Not academic. Readers are serious book people but not scholars.
Main story: I want to cover the recent pattern of publishers quietly cancelling debut novels after acquisition — sometimes months before publication — often because of social media controversies that emerged after the deal was signed. I've seen at least four cases this year. I want to argue this is creating a culture of self-censorship in submissions, where agents are advising debut authors to scrub their online history before querying.
Links section: Three items — (1) a piece in a trades publication about the trend; (2) a debut novelist who talked publicly about her book being cancelled and then self-published it successfully; (3) a quiet op-ed by a literary agent about how the submission process has changed since 2020.
Word count: ~800 words total
No recurring sign-off phrase.

### Output

**Opening**

There is a manuscript sitting in a drawer somewhere — maybe several — that will never be a book. Not because it wasn't good enough, and not because no one wanted it. Because someone, months after a deal was signed and a life was rearranged around the news, decided the risk wasn't worth it.

**Main Feature**

The Quiet Cancellations

Four times this year, I have watched a debut novelist's announcement tweet age badly — not because the book turned out to be bad, but because someone found something. An old post. A joke from ten years ago. A photograph, a thread, an affiliation. And then, before the advance had fully cleared, a phone call.

Publishers don't announce these cancellations. They appear as silences: a book that was in the spring catalogue and then wasn't, an author who stops appearing in interviews, a listing that disappears from Edelweiss. The industry processes them as business decisions. What they actually are is a kind of preemptive punishment.

What concerns me more than the cancellations themselves is what's happening upstream. Three agents I've spoken to informally in the past six months — none willing to go on record, which is its own kind of data point — have said the same thing in different ways: they now advise debut clients to audit their social media histories before querying. Delete anything that could read badly out of context. Make the profile clean.

This is new. Five years ago, an author's Twitter archive was not an acquisition risk. Now it's due diligence.

The argument publishers make, when they make any argument at all, is that they are protecting the book — that a controversy at launch poisons the sales environment and ultimately harms the author more than cancellation does. There is a version of this that is true. There is also a version of it that is a way of describing cowardice in the language of care.

What gets lost in this framing is the debut novel's particular position in a writer's life. A first book is not a product launch you can reschedule. For many writers it represents years of work and years of waiting, and the decision to submit it is an act of profound exposure. When that exposure ends not in publication but in a quiet phone call, the damage is specific and lasting. Some of those writers will try again. Some will not.

I don't think publishers are malicious. I think they are afraid, and that fear has quietly restructured the beginning of the pipeline in ways most readers never see. The question worth asking — the one the trade press has largely avoided — is what we lose when the books that get made are the books that offered no surface for controversy to attach to.

**Links & Reading**

**The industry view** — A recent piece in a publishing trades outlet documents the trend with more data than I have here, including the legal mechanics of how these cancellations are structured. Worth reading if you want the contractual picture, though it is written for industry insiders and pulls some of its punches. [Link]

**One author's way through** — The case of a debut novelist whose literary fiction deal was cancelled two months before publication after an old interview resurfaced. She spent three months not knowing whether to tell anyone, then self-published. The book has since sold more than 12,000 copies. Her account of the decision to go ahead anyway is the most honest thing I've read about what it actually costs to stay in. [Link]

**The agent's view** — A quietly furious op-ed by a literary agent about how much the submission process has changed since 2020. She doesn't mention social media directly — she doesn't have to. The phrase she uses is "manageability." I keep thinking about it. [Link]

**Sign-off**

I keep coming back to those books in drawers. Some will eventually find their way out, through small presses or self-publishing or the slow rebuilding of a career. Others won't. The ones that don't aren't a statistic. They are the specific, unrepeatable thing that particular writer had to say.

Until next week.

## Known Limitations
- Edition quality depends heavily on the richness of the brief — thin input produces thin drafts. Claude cannot invent specific facts, compelling quotes, or original reported angles; it can only develop what you provide
- Voice replication is approximate: the skill can match register and tone from a description, but will not perfectly clone the idiosyncratic style of a long-running newsletter without seeing multiple example editions
- The skill works best for essay-style newsletters. For data-heavy, listicle-format, or highly templated publications (e.g. "this week's five numbers"), specify the exact structure explicitly or the output will default to prose narrative
- Curated link commentary requires that you provide at minimum a one-sentence description of each piece; without that input, commentary will be generic
