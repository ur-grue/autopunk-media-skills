# Studio Intro Writer

## What This Skill Does
Writes a presenter-delivered studio introduction that sets up a field report or pre-recorded package, giving viewers the context and stakes they need before the package begins.

## When To Use This Skill
- A reporter's package is ready to air and you need a studio introduction for the presenter or anchor to read before the package rolls
- The programme editor has asked for an intro that goes beyond restating the headline — one that frames why the story matters right now
- You are running a multi-story bulletin and need intros that vary in register (hard news, human interest, investigative) to avoid every introduction sounding identical
- You have a late-breaking development that changes the framing of an existing package and need the intro rewritten quickly

## What You Need To Provide
**Required:**
- A summary of the package contents: what the report covers, who appears in it, and its main finding or revelation
- The news peg — why this story is being broadcast today, not last week
- Target duration for the intro (typically 20–35 seconds for a standard package intro)

**Optional:**
- The tone of the package (hard news, human interest, investigative, explainer)
- The name and title of the presenter, if the script should be personalised to a specific voice
- Any facts, statistics, or named individuals the presenter must introduce before the package begins
- Whether the intro will be read to camera or over a graphic or still image

## How Claude Approaches This
1. Identifies the single most important piece of context a viewer needs before watching the package — not a summary of the package, but what the viewer must understand for the package to land with full force
2. Constructs a short, clear opening sentence that carries the news value, followed by one or two sentences of essential context, ending with a clean hand-off line that cues the package without stating the obvious
3. Checks that the intro does not duplicate the first ten seconds of the package — the presenter's words and the reporter's opening should not repeat the same information

## Output Format
- Plain prose, one paragraph
- Sentences are short and declarative; spoken register throughout — contractions where natural
- Ends with a hand-off line that names the reporter and signals the package is beginning (e.g. "Correspondent Name has this report." or "[Reporter] reports.")
- No rhetorical questions, no speculation, no "only time will tell"
- Word count stated at the end in brackets, e.g. [62 words / approx. 25 sec]

## Quality Criteria
- [ ] The opening sentence carries a clear, specific news value — not a vague scene-setter
- [ ] The intro provides context the package does not provide — it does not duplicate the reporter's opening narration
- [ ] The hand-off line is clean and unambiguous — a viewer knows the package is about to begin
- [ ] Spoken register throughout — no phrase that would be awkward to say aloud
- [ ] Duration matches the requested target (within two seconds at 2.5 words per second)

## Example

### Input
Package summary: A six-month investigation into water contamination at a large industrial estate. The reporter interviews three residents with unexplained health problems and a former factory worker who describes unsafe chemical disposal practices. The main finding is that local authorities received complaints eighteen months ago but took no action.

News peg: Authorities announced this morning they are opening a formal inquiry.

Target duration: 30 seconds.

Tone: Hard news, investigative.

### Output
Authorities have opened a formal inquiry into contamination at the Harwick Industrial Estate — eighteen months after residents first filed complaints. Local families say they have been living with unexplained health problems, while a former factory worker has told our investigation that chemicals were routinely disposed of in breach of safety regulations. Our correspondent Maria Fontes reports.

## Known Limitations
- This skill writes the presenter's words only — it cannot verify that the facts in the intro match the final cut of the package; a producer must check them against the edited version before broadcast
- If the package opens with the reporter delivering a strong, fact-laden stand-up, the intro may feel redundant at first draft; share the package's opening narration as optional input to help Claude avoid duplication
- For very short news summaries (under 20 seconds), the intro may feel compressed; a brief (10–15 second) reader format may serve better — ask for a "reader" version if needed
