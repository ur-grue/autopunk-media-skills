# One Sheet Writer

## What This Skill Does
Produces a single-page sales document for a completed or nearly completed documentary, formatted for use at festival markets, in distributor meetings, and in international sales conversations.

## When To Use This Skill
- Your documentary is complete or in late post-production and you need a leave-behind document for distribution meetings
- You are attending a festival market (Cannes Docs, IDFA Market, Hot Docs Forum) and need a professional sales one-sheet
- A distributor or sales agent has asked for a one-sheet before deciding whether to screen the film
- You need to update your one-sheet with new festival credits or awards

## What You Need To Provide
**Required:**
- Film title and tagline (or ask Claude to draft a tagline from your description)
- Runtime and completion/release year
- A description of the film (2–4 sentences is enough)
- Director name and production company
- Genre and target audience (e.g., "feature documentary, broad theatrical/SVOD audience")

**Optional:**
- Festival selections and awards (list them all — Claude will format and prioritize)
- Broadcaster or platform acquisitions already made
- Key reviews or critical quotes (include the full quote and the publication name)
- Distribution or sales agent already attached
- Website URL or contact email
- Country of production and language
- Key financiers or funders to credit (if required by their agreement)

## How Claude Approaches This
1. Leads with the film's visual identity in text: title formatted prominently, tagline (or a generated one) immediately beneath, followed by the key technical specs in a single line
2. Writes the film description as a two-paragraph sales synopsis — first paragraph establishes the story and characters, second paragraph positions the film's emotional and editorial impact and its audience
3. Formats festival selections and awards as a clean, visually organized list, prioritizing the most prestigious entries and any prizes won
4. Adds a critical quotes block if quotes are provided, selecting the most specific and credible ones (avoids generic superlatives)
5. Closes with a credits and contact block: director, producer, production company, sales agent or distributor (if any), contact information

## Output Format
- Length: one page worth of content (approximately 300–400 words of body text, plus formatted credits and awards blocks)
- Structure: Title / Tagline / Specs → Film Description (2 paragraphs) → Festival & Awards → Critical Quotes (if available) → Credits → Contact
- Tone: editorial and assured — a one-sheet reads like a confident press release, not a pitch
- Formatting: designed for a designer to drop into a visual layout; clean section labels, no unnecessary punctuation or decoration
- All blocks clearly labeled so a designer knows where each element sits on the page

## Quality Criteria
- [ ] The tagline is one sentence that captures the film's emotional or thematic core — not a logline and not a genre descriptor
- [ ] The film description is specific enough to distinguish this film from any other documentary on a similar subject
- [ ] Festival selections are formatted with year and award tier (Competition, Special Presentation, World Premiere) where available
- [ ] If critical quotes are included, each quote is attributed to a named critic and named publication — no anonymous praise
- [ ] The contact block includes at minimum a company name and either an email or a URL

**THE FILM**

On a remote Sicilian island, a single man harvests salt by hand from the same flats his family has worked for five generations. He may be the last. *The Weight of Salt* follows one complete season on the flats — from the first flooding of the basins in spring to the final harvest in late summer — in a film that unfolds almost entirely without words, at the pace of the labor itself.

Shot over eight months with a single cinematographer and no crew larger than three, the film is a study in what endures when an economy, a technology, and a way of life have all moved on. Its subject is the salt. Its real subject is time.

## Known Limitations
- Claude cannot verify that festival credits are formatted according to the specific conventions preferred by each festival — for official festival catalogues, check with the festival's sales & industry office for their preferred credit line format
- If the film has no festival history yet (pre-release), the one-sheet will rely entirely on the film description and creative credits; this is a weaker document and Claude will flag this
- Tagline quality depends heavily on the description provided — a flat or vague description will produce a weak tagline; the more specific the input, the stronger the tagline
- This skill produces copy for a one-sheet layout; actual design (typography, image placement, visual identity) requires a graphic designer working from this copy
